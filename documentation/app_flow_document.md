# Auth-Template App Flow Document

## Introduction

This application is designed to offer a robust authentication system that works seamlessly on both a Next.js web app and an Expo mobile app. Users can sign up, sign in, sign out, and access protected pages using a unified Supabase-based authentication logic. The app supports email/password registration as well as OAuth with popular services like Google, GitHub, Facebook, and Apple. Once signed in, users are immediately redirected to their profile page where they can manage their posts. The design embraces a neo-brutalist style with a minimalistic approach and emphasizes comforting royal blue hues along with Aceternity UI components. Multilingual support in English and Turkish ensures that language preference is captured upfront via a modal, setting the tone for a consistent user experience across both platforms.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user visits the app, they are greeted with a landing page characterized by a neo-brutalist design. Immediately, a modal pops up prompting them to choose their preferred language between English and Turkish. This choice impacts all content within the app ensuring a personalized feel right from the start. On the web version, the navigation bar features clear sign in and sign up options, while on the mobile app, bottom tabs are used for navigation with clear entry points for authentication. In the sign up process, users are guided to fill in their username, password, and email while being informed of the basic password rules (at least eight characters and one special symbol). For users choosing to sign up via OAuth, after the initial native authentication, they are prompted to add a username and complete the registration process. A standard workflow is in place for password recovery, where users can initiate a reset process if they forget their password. Custom error messages are displayed in a casual tone in case of invalid credentials or if an email is already registered.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After successfully signing in or registering, the user is automatically routed to their profile page which serves as the main dashboard. For the web app, the profile page is easily accessible via the navbar while for the mobile app, it is one of the bottom tab options alongside the home page. The profile page displays essential user information such as their email and username. It also shows the posts users have created, making it the central hub for personal content management. The home page on both platforms features a feed of posts created by various users, clearly indicating the creator of each post. Navigation between the home page and the profile page is intuitive and consistently styled across both devices, ensuring users can switch views effortlessly.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

The authentication journey begins at the landing page where language selection is the first action. After making a choice, the user moves to the authentication screens. On the web, the navbar lets users choose between sign in and sign up while the mobile app uses dedicated bottom tabs for navigation. Upon entering the sign in or sign up pages, users fill in the necessary information and interact with responses provided by shadcn skeleton components for a smooth loading experience. If signing up with OAuth, after the external authentication via providers like Google, GitHub, Facebook, or Apple, the user is immediately asked to supply a username to complete the registration. A dedicated interface utilizing shadcn’s OTP input component is used when the app sends a 6-digit verification code to the user’s email. This component is designed to ensure that entering the code is quick and visually consistent with the rest of the application. Once a user is authenticated, protected pages become accessible. The app leverages database-based sessions through Supabase, including an automatic token refresh that occurs every time the user accesses the site. Throughout the application, robust rate limiting and throttling measures are employed. User actions such as login, password resets, and OTP requests are monitored per email and IP address. Custom casual error messages clearly inform the user if they reach any rate limiting thresholds.

## Settings and Account Management

Users can manage their personal information via a dedicated settings section accessible from the profile page. Here, they can update details such as their email address or username, and adjust their notification preferences. The settings also include controls for managing language preferences since the app provides multilingual support; users can change the language selection via the modal if needed. Profile management extends to post operations where users have full CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) capabilities on their posts. Any modifications made are immediately reflected on the profile page. The logout process is straightforward, allowing users to securely sign out and automatically invalidate their session, ensuring that subsequent visits require reauthentication. After updating any settings, the user is seamlessly returned to the main dashboard maintaining the flow of their journey.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Throughout the application, careful thought has been put into handling errors and alternate paths. If a user enters incorrect data during sign in or sign up, the interface immediately displays a custom error message written in a casual tone. In the event of rate limiting, such as exceeding the allowed requests per IP for logins or OTP submissions, users are informed exactly what limit has been reached and advised on a subsequent retry interval. If a user attempts to access a protected page without an active session, they are promptly redirected to the authentication pages. The system always ensures that, whether it is a network error, a validation failure, or a security throttling limit, users receive clear and friendly instructions on what to do next. This attention to error handling reinforces the overall resilience and usability of the application.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The Auth-Template delivers a seamless, secure authentication experience across both web and mobile platforms. Users begin their journey by selecting a language preference via a modal, ensuring that all subsequent interactions are personalized. The system then guides users through clear sign in and sign up processes that support traditional email/password login as well as OAuth methods. Once authenticated, users are automatically taken to a beautifully designed profile page where they can manage their posts and personal information. The application ensures robust security through Supabase-powered session management, automatic token refresh, and strict rate limiting measures, all while communicating any issues with custom and clear error messages. In its entirety, the app delivers a consistent, intuitive and secure user experience built around modern design principles and best practices in authentication.
