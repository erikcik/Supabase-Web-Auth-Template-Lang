# Tech Stack Document

## Introduction

This project, Auth-Template, is designed to deliver a robust and secure authentication system that works across both a Next.js web application and an Expo-based mobile app. The authentication logic covers all the essentials—sign in, sign up, sign out, protected pages, and a dedicated profile page—while also integrating popular OAuth providers like Google, GitHub, Facebook, and Apple. All user accounts and sessions are managed through a single Supabase database instance, ensuring a unified experience regardless of the platform. The project is built with modern, reliable technology choices that prioritize user experience, security, and consistency across devices.

## Frontend Technologies

For the web part of the project, we are using Next.js version 14 paired with TypeScript to ensure a robust, clean, and scalable codebase. Styling is handled by Tailwind CSS, enriched further by Aceternity UI, which supports our neo-brutalist yet minimalistic design ethos highlighted by comforting royal blue hues. Additionally, shadcn/UI components, including skeleton components, help provide immediate loading feedback to users, thereby enhancing the user experience. Component libraries such as Radix UI and Lucide Icons further contribute to a refined and accessible user interface. On the mobile side, the application leverages Expo SDK version 52 with react-native-reusables to share common components and nativewind for styling that keeps the look consistent with the web version. This multi-platform approach ensures that both web and mobile users enjoy seamless navigation and consistent design across the board.

## Backend Technologies

On the backend, Supabase takes center stage by handling both authentication and database management. Supabase Auth is used to set up fully fledged sign in, sign up, and sign out flows, along with support for OAuth integrations. The backend is structured to implement database-based session management, ensuring that every user session is validated and maintained with automatic token refresh whenever the user accesses the app. This design not only secures the application but also guarantees a smooth user experience by keeping session information up-to-date. The centralized Supabase setup allows the same authentication logic to be applied across the web and mobile platforms, thus reducing potential inconsistencies in user management.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

The project is hosted on reliable platforms to ensure consistent delivery and scalability. The Next.js app is published on Vercel, offering a robust hosting solution optimized for performance and scalability. For mobile, the Expo app has already been published as a development build, ensuring early feedback and continuous deployment. The mono repo structure seamlessly integrates both platforms, enabled by modern CI/CD pipelines and version control systems. This cohesive infrastructure guarantees that updates and improvements are deployed smoothly and efficiently, preserving the integrity and performance of the application across all environments.

## Third-Party Integrations

To enhance functionality and streamline development, the project incorporates several third-party tools and services. OAuth providers such as Google, GitHub, Facebook, and Apple are integrated through Supabase Auth, offering users flexible authentication options. On the development side, advanced tools like Cursor, an AI-powered coding assistant, help maintain code quality with real-time suggestions. Similarly, Claude 3.7 Sonnet is employed to support complex reasoning tasks during development. These integrations not only save valuable development time but also ensure that the application leverages state-of-the-art solutions for both user authentication and developer productivity.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Security is a major priority across this tech stack. The application enforces strong security measures, such as rate limiting and login throttling based on IP addresses and email inputs. These measures protect against brute force attacks by imposing restrictions like one attempt per second per IP, and progressively increased timeouts for repeated failed logins. Additional safeguards are in place for OTP verifications, with controlled attempt limits and expiration periods to maintain balance between usability and security. On the performance side, the use of skeleton components for loading feedback ensures that the interface remains responsive, with automatic token refresh mechanisms preserving session integrity. Together, these measures guarantee that the app remains both secure and user-friendly under various load conditions.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

The Auth-Template project harnesses a modern and unified tech stack to deliver a seamless cross-platform authentication experience. On the frontend, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and several UI libraries form the backbone of the web interface, while Expo, react-native-reusables, and nativewind ensure a consistent mobile experience. The backend’s reliance on Supabase for both authentication and database management ensures robust, centralized session control and security. Infrastructure choices like Vercel for hosting and mono repo development practices further solidify the project’s reliability and scalability. Overall, this carefully selected tech stack not only meets the security and performance requirements of a modern authentication system but also provides an elegant and consistent user experience across both web and mobile environments.
