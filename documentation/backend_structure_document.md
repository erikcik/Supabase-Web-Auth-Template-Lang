# Backend Structure Document for Auth-Template

## Introduction

This document outlines the backend setup for the Auth-Template project, which is built to provide a unified authentication experience for both a Next.js web application and an Expo-based mobile app. The backend is central to managing user sessions, authentication actions, and data storage across both platforms. It ensures that every user’s session—from signing in to managing their posts—is secure, well-organized, and in sync with the single Supabase database instance used by the project. The design is influenced by modern, secure practices and is aimed at delivering a smooth user experience on both web and mobile environments.

## Backend Architecture

The backend leverages Supabase as its core technology for both authentication and database management. Supabase Auth is used to implement sign in, sign up, sign out, protected routes, and OAuth functionalities with providers such as Google, GitHub, Facebook, and Apple. A mono repo structure is used to manage code for both the Next.js and Expo apps, ensuring that the same authentication logic and session management mechanism are applied uniformly. The architecture follows a service-oriented approach where various security measures like rate limiting and login throttling are built into the authentication workflows, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and high performance under load.

## Database Management

The project uses Supabase’s PostgreSQL database to store and manage data. This includes user information, session data, and user-created posts. Data is structured in a simple yet effective schema to capture details such as user email, username, and post content. With database-backed sessions, every time a user accesses the system, an automatic token refresh ensures that the session data remains current and valid. The single instance of the Supabase database reinforces data consistency across both the web and mobile platforms, simplifying data management and reducing potential synchronization issues.

## API Design and Endpoints

APIs have been designed following RESTful principles to facilitate clear and efficient communication between the frontend and the backend. Key endpoints include those for account management (sign in, sign up, and sign out), profile data retrieval, and posts operations (create, update, and delete). Special endpoints manage OAuth logic and username capture after an OAuth sign-in event, ensuring that users who sign up via external providers complete their registration with the required details. In addition, endpoints are integrated with rate limiting and throttling features to protect against abuse, ensuring that custom error messages are delivered in a clear, casual tone when limits are reached.

## Hosting Solutions

The backend is hosted using Supabase, a managed backend platform that supports the server-side logic and database operations essential to the application. Supabase provides not only a secure and scalable database environment but also built-in authentication services that align well with the project’s requirements. This hosting solution offers high reliability and cost-effectiveness, supporting rapid development and easy scaling as user demand increases. Additionally, the Next.js frontend is deployed on Vercel, while the Expo mobile app is published as a development build, ensuring that both environments are optimized for performance and continuous delivery.

## Infrastructure Components

Several infrastructure components work together to enhance performance and ensure a smooth user experience. The setup includes load balancers to distribute traffic evenly across the backend, caching mechanisms to accelerate frequently accessed data, and a content delivery network (CDN) to serve static assets quickly and reliably. These components are tightly integrated with Supabase, which not only handles the database and authentication but also provides function hooks for rate limiting and OTP verification workflows. This coordinated infrastructure ensures that even during high demand, the system remains responsive and secure.

## Security Measures

Security is at the forefront of the Auth-Template backend. The system implements robust authentication with Supabase Auth and includes multiple layers of protection. Authentication follows best practices with measures like password rules (minimum eight characters with at least one special token), email verification via a 6-digit OTP with controlled expiration times, and database-backed session management that automatically refreshes tokens. Furthermore, rate limiting and throttling mechanisms are in place to avoid brute-force attacks. Limits are applied based on IP addresses (such as one attempt per second for login) and by email. Custom, casually worded error messages inform users of any issues, whether it be too many attempts or session timeouts, ensuring clarity without intimidating users.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

To maintain robust performance and catch potential issues early, the backend includes comprehensive monitoring tools that track API usage, error rates, and system health. Automated logging captures events related to authentication, data access, and rate limiting events. Regular maintenance practices are scheduled to update dependencies, optimize database performance, and patch any security vulnerabilities. This proactive approach in monitoring and maintenance helps ensure that the backend stays reliable and that any issues are resolved quickly, keeping the system up-to-date and secure for all users.

## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

In summary, the Auth-Template backend is a carefully structured setup that integrates Supabase’s powerful authentication and database services to support both web and mobile apps seamlessly. It is architected to ensure data consistency via a unified Supabase instance and a mono repo structure, with RESTful APIs facilitating clear communication between client and server. The hosting on Supabase, coupled with Vercel for the web frontend, offers reliability, scalability, and ease of maintenance. With built-in security measures such as rate limiting, login throttling, and automatic session token refreshes, the system is designed to be both secure and user-friendly. This comprehensive backend structure not only meets the current project requirements but also provides a solid foundation for future enhancements and scalability, ensuring that Auth-Template remains a robust authentication solution for diverse platforms.
